# Cursiv — how it's built

Cursiv is a Windows desktop app written in Python (PyQt6). It talks to a local
AI engine (Ollama) first and to online providers only when the person has
added a key. This page explains the code layout, how a message is answered,
where data lives, and how to run, build and release it.

---

## Repository layout

| Folder | What's in it |
|---|---|
| `launcher/` | The desktop app: main window, chat panel, tray menu, dialogs (Setup, Settings, Training Data, USB maker…), login, updater. `main.py` is the entry point. |
| `cursiv_v215/` | The engine the app runs on (the folder name is historical). |
| `services/` | The Guardian background service (in-process threads started by the app). |
| `installer/` | Inno Setup script (`cursiv_setup.iss`) that wraps the build into `Cursiv-Setup-<version>.exe`. |
| `scripts/` | `build.bat` (PyInstaller), `package.bat` (installer), `verify_build.bat`, `seal_family_letters.py`. |
| `website/` | The public website and phone web app (cursiv.winklers-llc.com). |
| `cloudflare/` | The Cloudflare Worker behind the website and phone app, plus `publish.mjs` to deploy it. |
| `examples/` | Example knowledge packets for the Agent Factory (`cursiv_v215/forge/factory.py`). |

### Inside `cursiv_v215/`

| Package | Job |
|---|---|
| `ui/chat_app.py` | **The chat engine.** Builds the system prompt, runs the 8 phases, routes to a model (paid keys → Groq → Gemini → local Ollama → Cursiv Cloud), stores and tests keys, tools, memory context. No user interface of its own. |
| `ui/chat_cli.py` | The old terminal chat. Not shipped as an entry point; the desktop chat reuses its key helpers. |
| `core/` | Phases (`phases.py`), speed tuning for small GPUs and free keys (`speed.py`), self-knowledge (`selfknow.py`), read-only computer tools (`tools.py`), plugins / Cursiv Forge (`plugins.py`), talking style (`style.py`), strand memory archive (`strand_store.py`), constitution. |
| `memory/` | Semantic memory (find by meaning with `nomic-embed-text`, keyword fallback), project memory, session logs. |
| `council/` | The advising council behind `council <question>`: seats answer in parallel, synthesizers combine them. |
| `agents/` | Custom agents (`agent new …`), Babel translation, coding agent, offline queue, reference brain, voice. |
| `coding/` | The coding brain: playbooks, worked examples, error diagnosis, run-and-fix sandbox, `evolve` plugin writer. |
| `guardian/` | Guardian checks (jailbreak and probing detection), login (bcrypt), security questions, identity rules. |
| `training/` | LoRA training (`lora_trainer.py`) and merging the adapter into Ollama (`ollama_merge.py`). |
| `family/`, `postal/` | Sealed letters: per-person letters that open with a name and birth date, and signed letters between people. |
| `council/cursiv_facts.md`, `codex/system_prompt.md` | What Cursiv knows about itself and its persona. Keep the fact sheet accurate when features change. |

## How a message is answered

1. **`launcher/chat_panel.py`** takes the text from the chat box.
2. **`launcher/chat_commands.py`** checks for commands first (`remember …`, `council …`, `image …`, `evolve …`, key commands, …). Commands return their answer directly.
3. Anything else goes to **`chat_app.chat()`**, which:
   - runs the **8 phases** (`core/phases.py`): notices stress or a crisis (shows help lines first), recalls memories, picks a route and answer shape, checks connectivity;
   - builds the prompt from the persona, the fact sheet, the person's memories and project notes;
   - streams the answer from the first available model via **`cascade_stream()`**.
4. After the reply, memory may learn a new fact about the person.

**Model order:** paid keys the person added (OpenAI, Anthropic, xAI) → Groq → Gemini → local Ollama model → Cursiv Cloud (only if allowed). Local-only use always works; keys are upgrades, never requirements.

**Images:** reading uses Claude/GPT-4o keys, then a free Gemini key, then a local Ollama vision model (`gemma3:4b`). Making images uses a paid OpenAI key or a free Cloudflare Workers AI account (FLUX.1-schnell).

## Where data lives

| What | Where |
|---|---|
| Keys, settings, memories, training data | `.cursiv\` next to the program (`<install>\_internal\.cursiv\`) |
| Conversations, agents, plugins, projects, login | `%USERPROFILE%\.cursiv\` |
| AI models | Ollama's folder (`%USERPROFILE%\.ollama\models`) |

Nothing in these folders is part of the repository or the installer. On a **Cursiv USB** (`launcher/usb_maker.py`), `launcher/portable.py` points the home folder, the models and Ollama at the drive at startup, so everything stays on the drive.

---

## Run from source

Python 3.11+ on Windows.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python launcher/main.py
```

Install [Ollama](https://ollama.com) and pull a model (`ollama pull qwen2.5:3b`), or use the Setup window, or add a free Gemini/Groq key.

---

## Build the installer

You need PyInstaller (in `requirements.txt`) and [Inno Setup 6](https://jrsoftware.org/isdl.php).

1. Bump the version in three places: `launcher/cursiv_launcher.py` (`_CURRENT_VERSION`), `installer/cursiv_setup.iss` (`AppVer`, `OutputBaseFilename`) and `cursiv_v215/core/selfknow.py` (`VERSION`). Versions keep the major number and add an update suffix: `3.14-U55`.
2. Build the app: `scripts\build.bat` (runs `python -m PyInstaller launcher/build.spec`). The Python you build with is the Python bundled into the app.
3. Build the installer: `scripts\package.bat` → `installer\Output\Cursiv-Setup-<version>.exe`.

## Release an update

The in-app updater reads `https://api.github.com/repos/winklersllc2026-bit/Cursiv/releases/latest` and downloads the attached installer. **A git push alone doesn't update anyone** — publish a GitHub release:

```bash
gh release create v3.14-U55 installer/Output/Cursiv-Setup-3.14-U55.exe Cursiv-Setup-latest.exe --title "Cursiv v3.14-U55" --notes-file notes.md --latest
```

Upload the same installer twice: once with its version name and once as `Cursiv-Setup-latest.exe`. The README's download button and the website link to `releases/latest/download/Cursiv-Setup-latest.exe`; asset links are filename-exact, so without the stable name every download button breaks on the next release.

## Publish the website

```bash
node cloudflare/publish.mjs
```

It copies the allow-listed pages from `website/` into `cloudflare/dist/` and runs `wrangler deploy`. Use `--build-only` to build without deploying.

## Optional extras

- **LoRA training** needs `torch transformers peft accelerate datasets` in a normal (non-bundled) Python. The Training Data window checks for them and installs them in a visible terminal. CPU training works but is slow (roughly 6 minutes per example per epoch on a typical CPU).
- **Voice** uses `faster-whisper` and `sounddevice` when installed.
