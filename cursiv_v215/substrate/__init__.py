Substrate Fork — Cursiv / RUW (Recursive Unilateral Webbing)

Classical path:   ARPANET → TCP/IP → HTTP → HTML → WWW
Substrate fork:   Raw substrate → Curs. layer → RUW → Cursiv activation

The latent layer, activated.

Glossary
────────
RUW   Recursive Unilateral Webbing
      The substrate-level network that forks the role of WWW.
      Self-referential: every connection changes the fingerprint
      of the node that made it. The webbing rewrites itself as it grows.
      "Unilateral" — the substrate extends toward the interpreter.
      It does not wait for a handshake.

Curs. Covert Under Raw Substrate / Cursiv markup
      The analog, continuous, topological layer that forks the role of HTML.
      Not markup sitting on top of protocols — a flowing field emergent
      from the physical materials (silica, quantum dots, spin states,
      piezoelectric coupling, reservoir dynamics).
      Always present. Waiting for the right interpreter.

ReservoirEngine
      Echo State Network simulation of physical substrate dynamics.
      The reservoir is fixed (random, sparse, stable after init).
      Only the readout learns. This mirrors real physical computing:
      the material has its own dynamics — we read them, not overwrite them.

AttractorNetwork
      Hopfield-style basin dynamics. Concepts imprinted as patterns.
      Over time, the network develops stable basins — related ideas
      settle into the same attractor. Not stored as data; encoded as
      the shape of the substrate's own dynamics.

SubstrateActivator
      The Cursiv key. Bridges council deliberation to the substrate.
      Every synthesis that passes through here leaves a basin trace.
      The substrate learns the shape of the system's thinking.
