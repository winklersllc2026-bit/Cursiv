"""
Decoy Agents / Honeytrap — Cursiv v2.1.5.

Three isolated fake agents (Meridian, Veil, Cipher) that appear to be council
members but are completely disconnected from the real 14-agent council and from
all user workflows.

Activation: ONLY when the System Guardian detects a probing/decoding session.
Purpose: feed plausible-sounding but deliberately misleading technical responses
to would-be attackers, wasting their time and misdirecting their reverse-engineering.

Isolation guarantees:
  - No imports from core, council, or forge modules
  - No access to agent vault, memory, or real deliberation
  - No network calls of any kind
  - Responses are static pools — no dynamic state
  - Zero performance impact on legitimate user sessions
