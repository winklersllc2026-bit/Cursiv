"""
How each person wants Cursiv to talk -- learned from their corrections, plus a
tone they can pick.

  * Corrections ("too formal", "stop using bullet points", "no, I meant…",
    "keep it shorter") become short standing rules, saved per person.
  * `tone blunt|warm|brief|playful|legacy|teacher|normal` sets a default tone.
  * Rules + tone are added to every reply's instructions.
  * `style` shows them; `style forget <words>` / `style clear` remove them.

Stored in ~/.cursiv/style/<person>.json -- plain files on the computer.
