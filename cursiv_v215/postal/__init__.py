"""
Cursiv Postal — sealed encrypted letters between any two principals.

Letters are encrypted to a specific sender + recipient pair on a specific
machine. The seal.uuid (unique to this Cursiv installation) is required
to derive decryption keys. A clone of the repository without this file
cannot decrypt a single letter.

Contents are never written to disk in plaintext. Ever.
