**The speed of the answers reflects your hardware. The accuracy of the information must always be verified by you. Cursiv was not designed to replace human judgment — it was designed to support it.**

## Install in three steps

1. **Download** the installer with the button above and run it.
   Windows may say *"Windows protected your PC"* because Cursiv isn't from a big company — click **More info → Run anyway**.
2. **Create a username and password.** They're stored only on your computer.
3. **The Setup window** opens and installs Ollama (the free local AI engine) and an AI model, with progress bars. Pick a model, click Download, and start chatting while it finishes.

That's it — one window, nothing else to open. Updates arrive inside the app.

**Needs:** Windows 10 or 11 (64-bit) · 8 GB RAM · about 6 GB free disk for one model (more for extras).
**No download wanted?** Paste a free Gemini or Groq key in Setup and Cursiv answers right away.

---

## What it does

- **Chats offline** through Ollama on your own computer. Cursiv picks the right model for your graphics card.
- **Free keys are enough.** Add a free [Gemini](https://aistudio.google.com/apikey) or [Groq](https://console.groq.com/keys) key for faster, longer answers. Paid keys (OpenAI, Anthropic, xAI) are optional upgrades, never required. Cursiv tries what you have and falls back to the next one automatically.
- **Remembers you** — lasting facts about each person, learned from conversations or added with *"remember …"*. Everything stays on your computer. *"What I remember"* lets you see, edit and delete it.
- **Reads images** you paste in — offline with the free Gemma 3 model, or with a key.
- **Makes images** with a free Cloudflare account or a paid OpenAI key (type `image a lighthouse at dawn`). Offline models can't make images, and Cursiv tells you how to turn it on.
- **Helps you code** — step-by-step help with local coding models, error diagnosis, and a sandbox that runs and fixes the Python it writes.
- **The council** — ask `council <question>` and Cursiv's advisors each answer from their own angle, then one combined answer comes back.
- **Your own agents** — `agent new <name>: <job>` creates a specialist you talk to with `@name`.
- **Grows new abilities** — `evolve <idea>` writes a plugin, safety-checks it, tests it in a sandbox, and installs it only when you approve.
- **Learns your voice** — save examples in Training Data, then train a small personal model with LoRA and add it to Ollama.
- **Phone app** — link your phone to share one conversation with your computer.
- **Sealed letters** — write letters that only open for the right person.

## Cursiv on a USB

Tray menu → **Make a Cursiv USB…** copies Cursiv, its AI engine and your models onto a USB drive. Plug it into any Windows PC and double-click **Start Cursiv** — nothing gets installed, it works offline, and everything it saves stays on the drive.

- Everything together is about **30 GB** — use a **64 GB or bigger** USB 3 drive or USB SSD, formatted **exFAT**.
- By default the USB starts fresh, so you can **give someone their own Cursiv**. Tick *"Include my memories, keys and settings"* to make a private copy of yours.

## A note on the guardrails

Cursiv has a Guardian that checks messages for jailbreak and probing attempts, a local-only login, and a rule that nothing leaves your computer without your action.

These were not built to restrict you. Every guardrail exists to protect you — to keep your data from leaving without your knowledge, your identity from being impersonated, and your machine from being used against you. If the system feels locked down, that lock faces outward, toward the things that would compromise you. Not inward toward you.

Whoever installs Cursiv owns that copy. You have the final say over it.

---

## Why this exists

Every major AI system runs in the cloud — on someone else's terms, on someone else's servers, subject to someone else's decisions about what stays online.

Cursiv was built on a different premise. What happens to all the knowledge we've built when the internet goes down? When a service shuts off? When access is restricted?

**Cursiv is a knowledge seed.** Each install is a piece of AI that lives in a home, a workshop, a school, a studio. It grows with every conversation and can be trained on your own voice.

The goal is simple: **reduce the chance that future generations lose the systems of knowledge we are building for them.**

---

## Honest about what it is

**Speed** — local models run on your CPU and graphics card. A gaming PC is fast; an older laptop is slower. A free key makes any computer fast.

**Accuracy** — the model does its best, and it will sometimes be wrong, confidently. Treat answers as a starting point. Verify what matters.

**Coding** — built to get you most of the way there and help you understand the rest.

**Privacy** — with only local models, nothing you type leaves your computer. If you add a key, your messages go to that provider. Optional extras — Cursiv Cloud backup, the phone link, problem reports — only send anything when you turn them on or click them. The update check reads GitHub's public release list; nothing about you is sent.

**Ownership** — your data, your models, your copy. Nobody can change it or shut it off remotely.

## For developers

**[TECH.md](TECH.md)** explains how Cursiv is built — the desktop app, the chat engine, memory, the council, the Guardian, training, the USB edition — and how to run it from source and build the installer.

## About

Cursiv was designed and built by **Joshua Winkler**. It is shared freely: anyone with a computer should be able to have a real AI that runs on their own machine, without subscriptions, without cloud dependency, and without handing their data to anyone.

The world's knowledge should not live in one place. It should be spread across people, machines, homes and schools, so no single failure can take it all down.

Take it. Use it. Build on it. Make it yours.
