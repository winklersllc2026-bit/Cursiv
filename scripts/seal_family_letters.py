"""
Re-seal the family letters after editing them.

  1. Edit private/family_source.json  (git-ignored -- the only readable copy)
  2. python scripts/seal_family_letters.py
  3. Rebuild (scripts/build.bat) so the new sealed_letters.json ships.

Writes cursiv_v215/family/sealed_letters.json, which is safe to commit and ship:
each letter opens only with that person's name + birth date.
